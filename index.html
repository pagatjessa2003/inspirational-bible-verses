          <p>
            After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And
            they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God
            boldly.

          <p>
            I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In
            the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome
            the world.

        <div class="verses">
          <h4>Isaiah 41:10</h4>
          <p>
            So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your
            God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my
            righteous right hand.

          <h4>Philippians 4:6-7</h4>
          <p>
            Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer
            and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And
            the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard
            your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

        <div class="verses">
          <h4>Psalm 34:6-8</h4>
          <p>
            This poor man called, and the LORD heard him; he saved him out of
            all his troubles. The angel of the LORD encamps around those who
            fear him, and he delivers them. Taste and see that the LORD is good;
            blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verses">
          <h4>Romans 8:28</h4>
          <p>
            And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who
            love him, who have been called according to his purpose.

        <div class="verses">
          <h4>Joshua 1:9</h4>
          <p>
            Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be
            frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with
            you wherever you go.

        </div>
        <div class="verses">
          <h4>Matthew 6:31-34</h4>
          <p>
            So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we
            drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these
            things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek
            first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will
            be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for
            tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its
            own.
